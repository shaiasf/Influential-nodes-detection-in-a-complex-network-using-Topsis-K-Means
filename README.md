# Influential-nodes-detection-in-a-complex-network-using-Topsis-K-Means

In networks, not all nodes hold the same level of importance, and some are more critical than others. The issue of identifying the most important nodes in networks has been extensively studied, particularly for nodes whose significance is tied to the network's connectivity. These nodes are generally referred to as critical nodes. The Critical Node Detection Problem (CNDP) is an optimization problem that involves finding the set of nodes whose removal would most significantly degrade the network's connectivity according to predefined connectivity metrics. Various approaches to this problem have been developed.

In this project, we will begin this identification process using algorithms such as TOPSIS, WTOPSIS, and AHP. We will introduce the implemented methods and tools, present the different steps followed, and demonstrate the project's implementation.
